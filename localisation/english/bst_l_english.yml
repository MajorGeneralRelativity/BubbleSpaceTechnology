 bst_survey.3.desc: "Our science ship was surveying a frozen world when it detected an unusually regular series of voids buried under some of the snow and ice. Upon descending to investigate, our scientists and surveyors have uncovered what appears to be an abandoned installation constructed by an unknown alien race. While the ship cannot detect any thermal or electromagnetic signatures, the surveyors agree that a more detailed excavation by archaeologists is required."
